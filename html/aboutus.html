    Moving to Craighead from a small country school in Year 9 was a shocking and exciting experience. Though I feared that I would get mistaken for a Year 7 because of my height, I was eager to get involved with all the new opportunities that Craighead had to offer.
    Now, as a Year 13 student who still gets mistaken about my year group due to my height, I am thankful for all the experiences Craighead has given me over the years. These experiences have led me to where I am today and to have the privilege of being Head Boarder for 2021, alongside Pieta Prouting who has supported me right from the start, including one of our biggest Boarding House events, the boarders Weekend-In which was a great success with a lot of memories made. Being in the Boarding House has allowed me to enjoy my sports, make friendships for life and gain important skills that I can carry with me after I leave school. 
    Highlights of my time at Craighead include the many school camps and trips, attending Maadi Cup at Lake Karapiro and making the Hanan Shield Rugby team and involvement with other sporting events and committees within the school and the wider community. These have allowed me to grow as a person and set goals for myself to strive for success.
    For 2022, I am hoping to further my study at Lincoln University within the Agriculture sector. Being from a family-owned farm and contracting business I have always had an interest in heavy machinery, cropping and livestock. I cannot wait to see what opportunities this year brings, but I will be sure to cherish the memories of my last year at Craighead with my "hostel rangers" by my side.
