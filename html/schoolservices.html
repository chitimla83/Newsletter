<h2> Chapel</h2>
<p>As we continue into Lent, we begin the week by exploring fasting. Has there ever been a time in your life that you have fasted from something? Why did you fast? During Lent we often fast from an item, or a practice so that we can draw closer to God.
    Towards the end of the week, we wonder what is meditation? Meditation through a Biblical lens is about filling our minds with God's words. Of reading a daily Psalm or engaging in a Bible App. Phillipians 4:8 puts it: "Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable."
    DaVine Youth Group 6:30-8:30pm every Wednesday.
