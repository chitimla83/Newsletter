    <h2> Chapel</h2>
    <p>As we continue into Lent, we begin the week by exploring fasting. Has there ever been a time in your life that
        you have fasted from something? Why did you fast? During Lent we often fast from an item, or a practice so that
        we can draw closer to God.
        Towards the end of the week, we wonder what is meditation? Meditation through a Biblical lens is about filling
        our minds with God's words. Of reading a daily Psalm or engaging in a Bible App. <em> Phillipians 4:8 puts it:
            "Fix
            your thoughts on what is true and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable."</em>
        DaVine Youth Group 6:30-8:30pm every Wednesday.
