  <h2>Education Review Office Evaluation Partner</h2> 
  <p>
    Our ERO evaluation partner Mrs Shelley Wyllie conducted her initial visit on Monday of this week. The purpose of this meeting was to familiarise herself with the school and its context, and to meet the Chair of the Board of Trustees Mr Ant Ford, and the Senior Leadership team. She shared details of the new evaluation approach by the Education Review Office, in that a relationship is developed with the school over a longer time period, rather than an intense review over the space of one week, followed by a report. This time, we will agree upon a specific aspect of our strategic plan upon which to focus our evaluation (likely to be our Year 7-10 Curriculum), which will be adjusted to fit in with resource and time constraints. The next meeting is on the first day of Term 2, when we will identify existing internal evaluation capability in the school and reach agreement about a useful focus and scope for an evaluation based on our existing priorities.
