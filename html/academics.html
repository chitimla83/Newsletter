    The Female-only Defence Careers Experience (DCE) to be held at Burnham Military Camp on 28–30 April, is designed to give students a taste of NZ Army life, and is open to anyone with a bit of fitness, aptitude, and motivation. This is a great opportunity to gain an insight to what the Army has to offer as a potential career option, with leadership and resilience skills development and the chance to mix and mingle with likeminded people.
    A reminder that registrations close on 19 March 2021: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z5XPEmNl9RcBKJzmusU31WHff4X_dhccY196pe-8sRY/edit?ts=6036d126&gxids=7628
