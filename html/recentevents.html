    <h2> Wanaka Show weekend</h2>
    <img src="../wanaka-a-and-p-show.jpg" alt=wanakashow>
    <p>
        It is fortunate that the Wanaka Show is able to proceed as planned under Alert Level One. We will again have a
        presence there in our usual spot this Friday and Saturday as part of our regular marketing and promotions
        strategy. We do enjoy meeting up with Old Girls and prospective students and their families. Do pop in and visit
        the Craighead tent if you are coming to this fantastic show.

    <h2>Year 11 History Trip</h2>

    <p> Last week, Year 11 History students travelled to Arrowtown to gather resources for our History internals. On
        Wednesday, we went to Bendigo Goldfields and were provided with useful background information on the life of
        early miners and the dangers they faced. We visited the Goldfields Mining Centre, in the Kawarau Gorge. We all
        tried our hands at gold panning, although unfortunately nobody “struck it big”. Thursday was a busy and focused
        day for us, with access granted to the Lakes District Museum archives and a historical tour around Arrowtown,
        including the cemetery. Friday was spent visiting the Cromwell and Alexandra cemeteries and the Cromwell museum,
        to help with our internals. All the girls thoroughly enjoyed the trip and are grateful for the opportunities to
        explore Central Otago history. We would like to say a huge thanks to Mr Gibbs and Ms Reeves for driving the vans
        and putting up with us for three whole days, to the Dining Room staff for catering for us and to all the staff
        at Lakes District Museum, Goldfields Mining Centre and Cromwell Museum. Also, a massive thank you to Mrs
        Johnston for all the time and effort that went into organising this trip, as well as making sure it was
        enjoyable and informative.

    <h2>Year 12 Geography field trip to Aoraki Mt Cook </h2>
    <img src="../y12-geo-1.png" alt="view of mt cook">
    <p>
        “Do something new, New Zealand” is something that we have heard a lot over the past 12 months since our borders
        have been closed due to Covid-19. Last week, the Year 12 Geography students were lucky enough to put this catch
        phrase into practise and get out and explore the beautiful Aoraki Mt Cook whilst of course working on internal,
        and external assessments. Over the two days, we conducted research on the vegetation in different areas of the
        National Park, saw the incredible Tasman Glacier from the Tasman Lake and put together smaller pictures of
        information we had learnt in class for everything to come together and make sense. We also had sessions with DOC
        to learn more about glaciation and their perspective on the controversial 1080. The Glacier Explorers boat trip
        to the glacier was definitely a highlight and although the weather was definitely not what we had hoped for, we
        all managed to have an amazing time and explore a new part of our country. We would love to say a massive thank
        you to Miss Gilbert and Miss Smillie for organising and facilitating the trip. Without your efforts, this trip
        wouldn’t have been possible.

    <h2>Year 9 German</h2>
    <img src="../german-1.jpg.JPG" alt ="german class">
<p> In the Year 9 German class, we have been learning about how the <b>Fasching festival</b> is celebrated around Germany and combining this with learning the colours so we can describe our colourful <b>Faschingsmaske!</b> Do you recognise the faces behind the masks?
