        <p>
            Former Head of Art at Craighead, and much respected friend and colleague, Ms Glenys Parry passed away
            peacefully on Monday following a lengthy battle with cancer.
            Glenys was passionate about Art, having studied at the University of Canterbury, majoring in Sculpture, then
            spending 5 years in Auckland making jewellery from her Auckland studio. She trained as a teacher at the
            Christchurch College of Education, then spent several years traveling through Africa, the Middle East and
            Europe. From there, she returned to teaching in Christchurch, eventually moving to teach at Craighead in
            1995.

            Ms Parry was an inspirational teacher - evidenced by the quality of Art produced by her Art students. Over
            the years, Craighead Art students achieved numerous Scholarships in Painting, Photography and Sculpture. Her
            students’ folios were often included in the Top Art roadshow, and they achieved many successes in local and
            regional Art competitions. Through Art, Ms Parry saw young people develop, drawing from their personal
            background and celebrating their cultural heritage. Ms Parry also believed that embracing visual
            communication in the digital age was essential and that student development benefitted from a holistic art
            education. In March 2018, Ms Parry was honoured to receive an ASG National Excellence in Teaching Award
            (NEiTA), one of six teachers from around New Zealand to take out a $5000 national teaching award. She was so
            deserving of this award for teaching excellence.

            What made Ms Parry a great teacher was her passion, her love of Art, her love of Art practice, and her love
            of creativity. She was kind, caring and collegial. We will miss her. Our thoughts and prayers go out the
            Parry and Armstrong families, especially her husband Michael and their two sons.
